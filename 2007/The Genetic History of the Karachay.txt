Abstract
The Karachay-Malkar population of the Northwestern Caucasus Mountains has an
unclear history. Oral traditions say that they are descended from Alans, who were ancient
Iranian tribes. The language they speak is a Kipchak Turkic language, and was supposedly
brought to the Caucasus by the invading Qumans from the Minusinsk Basin (Yenisei River-Altai
Mountains). They are also supposedly related to the Bulgars, and the name Malkar/Balkar is
evidence for this affiliation.
To elucidate their genetic past, this study compares the frequency of Karachay
mitochondrial DNA haplogroups from 67 individuals with previously published results from
other populations nearby. In general, it was hypothesized that the Karachays would be more
similar to other Caucasus populations and Central Asian Turkic populations.
Results indicate that the most similar population was indeed a Caucasus population, the
Adygei, but other Caucasus populations and geographically close populations in the region were
not similar in haplogroup frequency. Eastern Iranians were the next most similar, and indicate
that the theory involving ancestry to the Scythio-Iranians (Alans) may be true. Also, Altaians
showed similar haplogroup types, and somewhat similar frequencies. They might indicate the
ancient Turkic origins of the Karachays from the Altay Mountains.
This study was helpful in clarifying some aspects of the Karachay past, but further
research is needed in both the fields of mitochondrial DNA analysis and Y-chromosome analysis
to identify paternally inherited genetic influences on the Karachay population.

I. Background
I. 1 History of Turkic Peoples and the Karachay-Malkar
The diverse clans and groups that represent the Turkic peoples have dispersed from their
original homeland in the Allay Mountains in present-day Mongolia and Kazakhstan. Turkic
peoples now inhabit most of the Central Asian steppes and Eurasia west to Turkey. The earliest
known records of Turks, the Huns, come from China in the 3'd century BC (Menges, 1968, 17).
The Huns are well known as the tribes who warred against the Chinese Empires for 500
years after this date. They had begun westward expansion in the first century BC, and became a
threat to the West and the Roman Empire in the 4th century AD. Around this time also, other
Hunnic tribes arrived on the steppes between the Danube and Volga. They were the Saraguroi,
Urogoi, and Onoguroi, and were mentioned by Byzantine historians at about 463 AD. These
tribes joined the Hun confederacy led by Irnak, Attila's son, and after 482 AD, the confederacy
was called Bulgaroi by historians, and the name has led to some confusion about their ethnicity
(Menges, 1968, 18-9).
The name Bulgar is connected historically to Bulgaria, as we shall see later, but it is also
related to Malkar or Balkar (m and b interchangeable phonetically in the language). This could
be a kinship relation or it could also be just a coincidence, since the Balkar/Malkar live near the
Maiga River in the Caucasus. The Malkar are ethnically the same as the Karachay and speak the
same language, with a few phonetic differences, separated in the Caucasus by the mountains.
They distinguish each other simply as if they are different clan names, and frequently intermarry. The names Alan, Ars/As, Kipcak, and Bulgar are all related to the Karachay ethnic
identity in different ways (vide infra).

5

The confederacy stretched from modern northeastern Bulgaria to the Kuban River area in
the northwest Caucasus, which the Karachay people call home, and which was the center of the
confederacy. It is unknown whether the Bulgaroi were Hunnic in origin or merely connected
with the Hunnic confederacy, but a separate tribe. However, trihes under the name of Bulgaroi
were among the first Turkic speaking immigrants in Eastern Europe (Menges, 1968, 20).
In 555 AD, the Mongolian A vars came from East Central Asia, following the same path
as the Huns had earlier, and rode through Eurasia to the Balkans to conquer the Roman Empire.
They probably were the first to introduce the title Qaghan (Kaan) to mean the chief or ruler, in
place of the older term "Jabghu." Despite this, the ethnic and linguistic composition of the area
does not seem to have changed, since the A vars were eager to move on and conquer (Menges,
1968, 20).
Meanwhile, in Central Asia, two other Turkic tribes united in the late 5th century to form
the Turkut (plural of Turk) confederacy, as mentioned in Chinese sources. The Turkut expanded
to the West and soon gained much power. They controlled the steppes between Kazakhstan and
the Volga region, and came into contact with the Bulgaroi, Hunnic tribes, and Xazars, who were
incorporated into the western Turkut confederacy (Menges, 1968, 21 ).
The Chinese defeated the Turkut in the east in 581, which caused the Turkut confederacy
to divide into the Western Turkut, centered in Kazakhstan, and Eastern Turkut, or the Gokturk,
centered in northern Mongolia (Menges, 1968, 22). From this split on, the history of the
Karachay is mostly concerned with the Western Turks until the Middle Ages.
Before the Altaic invasions began in the 3'd century BC, there were many Iranian and
Iranized tribes living in the Central Asian region around the Caspian Sea at different time
periods, such as the Sogdians, Sarmatai, Medes, and Kurds. Among them, one comes across the

6

names Alanoi (Alans) and Arsoi (Ars) (Menges, 1968, 24-5). Karachays call each other "Alan"
informally in personal conversation. For example, they would say, "Alan, where have you
been?" Karachay oral tradition says that they have descended from the Alans or Ars (As), which
means "real" or "original." However, if these nomadic tribes were supposedly Persian-speaking,
it would be difficult to explain why the Karachays today speak a Kipchak Turkic language (as
opposed to Oguz Turkic or other Turkic). The Alans may have been originally Turkic, and
spoke a Turkic language. Some of the texts attributed to them have been analyzed and seem to
make more sense if interpreted using the Karachay-Balkar language rather than Persian (Zakiev,
1995, 38-57).
Many of the tribes that made up the Western Turkut confederacy were Oguz tribes, and
had a different dialect from other Turkic tribes and from those in the East. These Oguz tribes
became more powerful and conquered more of the Middle East, forming the Seljuk Confederacy,
and the Islamic Seljuk Empire (Menges, 1968, 26). The Oguz tribal groups in the Aralo-Caspian
region began to occasionally clash with the Pecenegs, who were part of the later Northwest
Turkic tribal confederacies, the Kipchaks, along with Bulgars, Xazars, and others. They were
eventually incorporated into the Oguz confederacy and were all converted to Islam by the end of
the 11 th century (Menges, 1968, 27).
When Seljuk power declined in the Western part of the empire into small regional
dynasties, one of them from Anatolia, the Osman tribe, eventually produced the leaders who
conquered the Byzantine Empire in 1453 to form the Ottoman Empire (Menges, 1968, 28).
The above mentioned Oguz tribes were the progenitors of the modern Turkic populations
of Turkmenistan, Iran, Trans-Caucasia, Anatolia and the Balkans. These peoples show physical

7

features of admixture with the local Iranian, Arab, and other populations, unlike the other Altaic
peoples (Menges, 1968, 21-9).
th

Going back further in time, in the 7 century, the Xazars, tribes who represented the
westernmost of the Western Turkut, became independent and moved into the Kuban River,
where Karachays are located, and even the Dnepr River area. They ruled their state using
ancient Turkic traditions such as the double rule ofQagans (Chiefs) and Beys (Local Princes).
They kept other religious influences out of their area until about 740, when they accepted
Judaism as the state religion (Menges, 1968, 29). The Xazars had control over all of Eastern
Europe from the Dnepr to the Ural River from 680 nntil they were defeated by the Turkic
Qumans in 1030, exhibiting control over the Normano-Russian Great Princes ofKijev as well as
the Volga Bulgars (Menges, 1968, 30).
The Xazars were not uniformly Turkic. They had various groups of different ethnic and
linguistic affiliation. It is said that there were two distinct groups within these.

One group

was dark skinned ( called Black Bulgaria) and spoke a language different from Turks but similar
to Bulgars, possibly Hnnnic, Hunno-Bulgarian, or Bulgaro-Turkic. The other was fair skinned
and possibly Finno-Ugric or Ugric and Proto-Hnngarian. This is confusing, though, since some
Turkic groups were also fair skinned, blue-eyes, and blonde-haired, like the Qumans. This could
be a result ofNorth-Iranian, Alanic, influence (Menges, 1968, 30-1). Today, the Karachays also
have differing physical traits. Some look like the Central Asian Altaic peoples, who exhibit
more Asian traits, and others have blond hair, blue eyes, and very fair skin!
During Xazar rule, there were two tribal movements of the Bulgars. A ruler named
Qubrat, who was baptized in Constantinople in 619, was able to establish a center of rule in the
Kuban area, and called it Great Bulgaria. Later, one of his sons migrated into western Byzantine

8

territory, and settled between the Balkans and the Danube. The Bulgarians spread out, and over
time, their language, Altaic-Bulgarian, became more Slavic as their culture and religion also
were influenced by Christianity and the Greek civilization. Today, however, the present -day
Bulgarian populations exhibit "very strong features of the High Asiatic or Altaic racial type,
much more so than their immediate and eastern neighbors, the Osman-speaking Oguz Turks of
the Balkans and even Anatolia" (Menges, 1968, 31).
The second tribal migration was up the Volga River, facilitated by the Xazars, who
wanted the Hunno-Bulgarian tribes in their realm further from their center of state. There, the
Bui gars converted to Islam in 922 AD. When the Qumans and Pecenegs defeated the Xazars in
th

the 11 century, they spread the Kipcak Turkic language in Eastern Europe. This is the Turkic
language type that the Karachays speak.
In 1236, the Mongols of the Golden Horde conquered the Volga region, destroying the HunnoBulgar or Volga-Bulgar realm (Menges, 1968, 32).

It is well-known among the Karachays that this is also the conquest that forced the
Karacay-Balkar to flee to the higher elevations to avoid conflict. The Mongols began the
Turkicization of the area. They absorbed the Hurmo-Bulgarians who were still living along the
Kuban River, "Black Bulgaria", after the Xazars fell in the late 11 th century. The Turkicized
descendants of these "Black Bulgarians" are said to be the Karachay-Balkar in the Caucasus!
The name Balkar could be, as stated earlier, a continuation of Bulgar or it could be related to the
name of the Malqa River in the area (Menges, 1968, 32). Although the Mongols "Turkicized"
the Bulgars, it is likely that the Karachay-Malkar were already speaking Kipcak Turkic,
influenced by Qumans.

9

The history of the Qumans is complicated. The tribal name Quman is probably derived
from the Turkic quba, meaning "yellow-red, reddish, yellowish," referring to the color of their
hair, since they were fair skinned and haired, as previously stated, and which distinguished them
from the other Altaic peoples (Menges, 1968, 35). Before moving west, the Qumans were
originally part of a larger Mongolian tribal confederacy, the Qaj, whose older name was
Komagqaj, an older version of "Quman." They lived in northeast Mongolia, just east of the
Qirgiz (whose language today is one of the Turkic languages most similar to Karachay)
(Menges, 1968, 35).
The Yenisej Qirgiz are named in Chinese sources the Gjan-kun (Kun is also the name of
the Quman in Hungarian). These Qirgiz are also described by the Chinese as "green-eyed, fairskinned, and blond," like the Quman. They are the only two Altaic groups which physically
stand out in this way. Today, there are still people with these features in the Minusinsk Basin. It
seems these un-Asiatic features are remnants of the far eastward migration ofEurapoid Scythian
or Scythoid populations (perhaps even those Iranian Arsoi and Alanoi originally from the
Caucasus) or of even older Paleo-European populations (Menges, 1968, 36). If the former
theory is correct, it seems like the ancestors of the Karachay may have originally been from the
Caucasus after all, and went eastward only to come back westward and settle in the Caucasus
again as Qumans (Figure 1) !
There is also archaeological evidence of a Europoid migration of Scythian or later Iranian
or Indo-European group into the Altay and Minusinsk region. Evidence has been found of
Caucasian style metallurgy, "Animal Style." The Qirgiz who descended from these peoples also
acquired the metallurgical culture, and their weapons and metal work were held in high esteem

10

by the Chinese. Traces of their industry can still be found in the forests and mountain of the
Minusinsk region (Menges, 1968, 48-9).
In the Tien-Shan Mountains of Central Asia, these Qirgiz were able to preserve their
culture and separate themselves from outside influence, just like the Karachay-Balkar preserved
their culture and people in the Caucasus Mountains (Menges, 1968, 43). The mountains
protected many small groups of people in this way, safeguarding languages and cultures to this
day, though many are dying out quickly. Perhaps the ancestors of the Karachay, already having
good experiences in the eastern mountains, knew that the best place to settle to save their culture
was again in another mountainous country!

I. 2 The Karachay-Malkar People and Culture Today
Although many Karachay are devout Muslims today, it seems that their religious heritage
has been varied and not well documented. It is clear, however, that they were originally pagans,
as all the Turkic peoples have been, and worshipped deities of nature, with Teyri (Tanri) as the
chief god.
The Karachay may have converted to Christianity, Judaism, and Islam back and forth
throughout the history of the various peoples who inhabited the region, but they always kept
clements of their pagan traditions alive (Musukaev and Musukaev, 2007). Even today, there is
mention ofTeyri Terek, the "Sacred Tree God" among the elder members ofKarachay society.
There are also still several superstitions and names referring to the deities and spiritual beings of
nature that controlled the universe of the ancient Karachay.
The Karachay and Malkar were definitively Muslim by the 1800s, though, and by this
time had mostly given up their former mixed religious beliefs, even the eating of pork

11

(Curtubayev, 2006). There is a story of one ofmy mother's family clans, Chomalari or
informally, Chochkalari, which means "baby pigs." According to our oral history, they were
supposedly very successful in the rearing of pigs, and when they were converted to Islam, one
woman of this clan would eat pork in secret, declaring "May God curse those who separated us
from you [referring to their beloved pigs!]"
Despite this story, it is well known in history that the Karachay and Malkar have been the
most successful group in the Caucasus in developing hardy sheep and horse breeds, often having
thousands at a time in their individual sheep flocks (Karca, 1954). They have even won medals
for their good breeding stock in livestock shows in London, Russia, and elsewhere.
It is also interesting to note that the Caucasus may have been one of the earliest sites of

domestication of sheep, if not the earliest, and a mitochondrial lineage not found elsewhere has
been found in Karachay sheep, indicating the antiquity of domestication in the Caucasus (Tapio
et. al. 2006). The Karachay/Malkar have long been producing high quality livestock as an
integral part of the regional economy.
To be able to maintain these large numbers of sheep, Karachays employed many laborers,
and distinguished them as the "kuls," or servant class. The wealthier owners of the stock were
called "biy," or "bey" in Turkish, and the society was somewhat feudal in nature (Karca, 1954).
It is said that one of the Karachay villages in Turkey consists almost entirely of those that were

of the laboring class in the Caucasus homelands, and it has often been remarked that they "do
things differently" than other Karacays. This type of class differentiation among the Karacays
and their former "kul" has only recently become less pronounced, since the migrations to Turkey
and then the United States. The following is a short account of how they came to those parts.

12

The Karachay and Malkar people had long been living in the mountains when the
Russian Tsars decided to take over their land in the late 16th century. The Caucasus mountain
peoples, especially the Muslim groups, defended their homelands bravely for hundreds of years,
keeping the Russian armies at bay temporarily. Imam Shami! was one of the most famous
leaders of the freedom loving mountaineers who rebelled against the Russian conquests.
However, the lengthy Caucasus Wars took their toll on the populations. The area of the
north Caucasus by the Kuban River, the Circassian and Karachay lands, were the last to finally
fall to Russian power in 1864. Tsar Nicholas I expelled and killed many of the native inhabitants
who were left, including 600,000 "Circassians" (which probably comprises more than just
Circassians, but also the other North Caucasus peoples in the same area, like Karachay-Balkar)
and settled Russians in their place. In this time, many Karachays, Balkars, and others fled to
Turkey and the Middle East to escape the repression. When Russia and Turkey started fighting
again in 1877, revolts were revived, but were fruitless. In 1917, the Tsarist regime fell in the
October revolution (Conquest, 1960, 2-9).
When the Soviets came into power, the Caucasian ethnic minorities were given promises
of land and freedom, many of which were not kept (Conquest, 1960, 19). Various borders were
drawn and dissolved, and drawn again. Different peoples were united and broken up, united with
other groups, and so on.
In WWII, the Karachay/Balkars, Ingush, Chechens, and others were accused by Stalin of
helping the Nazis and were deported from their lands by the thousands in cattle trains. Many
thousands died of starvation, disease, and exposure, mostly old people and children. The
Karachays alone lost over 25% of their potential population when at least 70,000 of them (nearly
all of the total population of Karachays) were deported to many locations in Central Asia and

13

Siberia to work in concentration camps (Comins-Richmond, 2002). After these deportations,
most returned to their homelands when access was returned to them, and some migrated to other
countries like Turkey.
Today, there is a total Karacay/Balkar speaking world population of about 241,000
(Seegmiller, 1996). Most are in Karachay-Cherkessia, but there are significant numbers in
Turkey and other countries of the Middle East, where they took refuge from persecution in the
late 1800s and again after WWII.
From Turkey, a number ofKarachay migrated to the United States beginning in the
1960s and 70s. They are centered in Paterson, NJ, and are the subjects of this genetic study. A
few members of the population have come directly from the Caucasus as well. They constitute
in NJ a closely-knit ethnic group which still maintains its language, traditional folkdances, and
religious beliefs, rarely marrying with non-Karachays, though there are several cases. There may
also have been intermarriage with Turks in Turkey, though this is also probably not too common,
since the Karachays settled in separate villages in Turkey, where the entire village population
was Karachay. It is still frowned upon to marry a Turk, rather than a Karachay, let alone
someone of a different language group and religion, mostly for reasons of good marriage
relations based on common culture.

I. 3 History of Genetic Studies in the Cancasns
Many different ethnic and linguistic groups inhabit the Caucasus Mountains. The
diversity and uniqueness of the languages is such that the Caucasus has been known as the
Mountain of Tongues (Colarusso, 1992, 1). The origins of these groups of people have been
recorded in their oral histories, but over time, discrepancies, mixing of accounts, and loss of oral

14

history has led to an unclear picture of how each group came to settle in these mountains. Several
of the groups trace their ancestry to the Alans, about whom little is known. Some sources
describe Alans as Turkic, while others say they are Iranian in origin.
For these reasons, people have focused on the genetics of Caucasus populations in a few
studies. Early ones were conducted using blood groups, immunologic, and biochemical markers.
There were several of these done on the Karachay, Balkar, and nearby populations in the early
1990s (Nasidze et. al. 1990). Some studies indicated that these populations were not restricted
by the mountains or geographic barriers in gene flow, but more through linguistic or ethnic
subdivision. However, those distinctions were sometimes superficial, and there were patterns of
language replacement not associated with genetic and migratory movements (Barbujani et. al.
1994). Other studies showed that the Caucasus populations are not descendants of Neolithic
farmers who expanded across Europe, but may be earlier migrants (Bulayeva et. al. 2003).
Recently there have been quite a few genetic studies on the Caucasus, but none have solid
evidence on the Karachays, or if they do, they are inaccessible to me (in Russian). The literature
that I found had very few Karachay samples and did not list the important sequence data.
Therefore, the interesting history and lack of genetic studies make Karachays good candidates
for mitochondrial genetic research.

1.4 Specific Aims of My Study
Mitochondrial DNA is passed down only through the mother of each person. It is not in
the nucleus of each cell, but in the tiny mitochondria in the cytoplasm that produce energy for the
cell. Instead of being in chromosome form, as nuclear DNA is, mtDNA is circular and only

15

about 16,500 base pairs long. The length, maternal inheritance, and lack of recombination make
mtDNA ideal for quick molecular analyses.
I used this mitochondrial DNA to study the maternal gene pool of the Karachays,
comparing my results to those of previous studies involving populations in the Caucasus, Russia,
the Middle East, and Central Asia. By looking at the frequencies of West and East Eurasian
maternal haplogroups in each of the populations and the Karachays, I was able to draw some
conclusions about which of them have influenced the Karachay population more than others
(relative genetic contributions), and where geographically these influencing factors may have
come from. My historical analysis will also be helpful in this regard.

II. Research Design and Methods
II. 1 My Discovery of Molecular Anthropology aud the Beginning of My Research
Before stumbling upon a certain research poster on a Penn Museum wall, I had no idea it
was possible to trace the genetic history of a population using DNA. The research was Dr.
Schurr's, and it was about Native Americans' genetic relationship with Altaian peoples. I had
known from our oral history that my ancestors were Turkic, and they had originally come from
the Allay Mountains, so I felt an immediate personal connection to this unique research. I
wondered if the same kind of study could be done on my particular community of ethnic
Karachays in northern NJ. I was satisfied with an answer within a few moments, noticing that
Dr. Schurr's office was just in front of the poster. I knocked on the door to discover him inside.
He was kind enough to invite me in and listened to my enthusiastic plea to do this study with
him. I was immediately comforted to know that I would soon be starting my spur of the moment
research!

16

Dr. Schurr and I wrote up a proposal for my study to be reviewed by the University of
Pennsylvania Institutional Review Board. Soon after, the approval was issued, and I began my
project.
That summer, I started collecting samples for my project. Because I am a member of a
closely-knit Karachay community in northern NJ, I was able to relatively easily approach people
for sample donation. Karachays are easily offended and perplexed by non-direct contact from
people they know personally, so I had to meet people in person to collect samples, which made
the process more accurate and secure as well. Because social rules about talking to unrelated
members of the opposite sex are so strict in our community, my mother and father were a great
help in the collection of samples. Also, that they are older and more well-known than I am was a
benefit.
In general, our closer relatives were eager to donate, while people who were less related
to my family were more suspicious. Relatives are considered to be those who have a common
ancestor from up to seven generations back. Thus, the sample may have been somewhat biased,
but I do not think it had a large impact. The final results show that the samples, from 67
participants, were diverse.
Because most of the people I was sampling had no idea what DNA even was, or how
genetics could be used to give information about their origins, I explained to each of them
personally what the project actually meant. I asked them about themselves and their families
(date of birth, birthplace, ethnicity) as far back in generations as they could remember. Most
could only remember up to their grandparents. I wrote this information down myself, and also
wrote down to which clans their relatives belonged (Appendix I-Genealogical Form). There are

17

many clans in the Karachay, perhaps over thirty, but most of the participants seemed to belong to
the major ones.
This was not a problem because marriage rules in the Karachay community dictate that
one can only marry someone if they had no common ancestors for seven generations back. In
other words, exogamy prevailed, and I would expect more diversity even if participants were
representative of a few clans.
In addition to the interviews, participants read and signed Informed Consent forms
(Appendix II) to protect their privacy, with the option to withdraw if they wanted to later. Their
identities were kept anonymous in all parts of the research project; only my advisor, Dr. Schurr,
and I have this information. The individual results I have uncovered will be sent to each
participant, along with a general and anonymous analysis of the Karachay population as a whole.

11.2 Laboratory Methods and Procedures

Sample Preparation and DNA Extraction
I collected buccal (cheek) cells from each participant through a cheek scraping method
using an Omni Swab applicator. The swabs containing the buccal cells were ejected into small
cryovials containing 2.0 ml sterile IX TE buffer, pH 8.0, and vial caps wrapped in parafilm to
prevent loss of buffer volume.
At the molecular anthropology lab at Penn, I vortexed the buccal samples to resuspend
the cells in solution, and then centrifuged (15 min, 14K rpm) the buffer solution with suspended
cells to collect the cells in the pellet at the bottom. The cells were lysed with detergent and the
DNA was extracted with phenol-chloroform (Maniatis et. al. 1982). Purification with ethanol

18

followed, and dried DNA samples were re-suspended in water as stock solutions. The stocks
were used to create I: IO dilutions that were used in all the following tests.

Mitochondrial DNA Analysis
The mtDNA studies involved single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) analysis and control
region (CR) sequencing to characterize maternal haplogroups (more general) and haplotypes
(specific lineages within haplogroups) (Schurr et al. 1999). Previous studies have resulted in the
knowledge of a universal mitochondrial tree, in which the many individual sequences of
mutations have diverged from a single mitochondrial "Eve." Haplogroups are those sequences
(haplotypes) that have common originating points of divergence, and are grouped together
phylogenetically. Haplogroups and subhaplogroups are defined using letter and number
designations.
Hypervariable region I (HVRI) (nucleotide positions 16000-16400) of the control region
(CR) was sequenced using the primers and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) conditions reported
in Schurr et al. (1999). HVS-I sequencing provides an individual pattern of mutations that have
occurred in this region of the mitochondrial genome within each individual's mtDNA, and also
identifies key nucleotide mutations that define its broader mtDNA "haplogroup." These defining
changes have been characterized from extensive previous studies.
All sequencing reactions were read on ABI 3 l 30xl DNA Analyzers in the Laboratory of
Molecular Anthropology, and the resulting sequences aligned and compared using the
Sequencher 3.1 software tool (Gene Codes Corporation).
The SNP analysis gives information about whether a particular mutation that is expected
for a specific haplogroup (from previous published work) is present or not. The region where the

19

mutation is expected is amplified using PCR and the mutation is discovered by trying to cut it
with restriction endonuclcases, which cut at known base pair sequences. Based on whether the
target mutation is present, the resulting base pair pattern either conforms to this cut location or
not, and the DNA is cut accordingly. The restriction enzyme digested samples are run on
agarose gels to separate the different lengths of DNA fragments. The number of fragments, and
their size indicates whether the enzyme cut or not, and thus whether the mutation which defines
the haplogroup is present or not.
The SNP analysis involves screening Karachay samples for mutations that define West
Eurasian [H-K, N, R, T-X] (Torroni et al. 1994b, 1996, 1998; Macaulay et al. 1999), East
Eurasian [A-G, M, Y, Z] (Torroni et al. 1993, 1994a; Schurr et al. 1999; Kivisild et al. 2002),
and Indian (Kivisild et al. 1999, 2003; Bamshad et al. 2001; Palanichamy et al. 2004)
haplogroups (lineages). These are the ones most pertinent to the genetic history of the Karachay.

Phylogenetic Analysis
I constructed a tree using the median-joining network method (Bandelt et al. 1995, 1999).
This allowed me to generate phylogenies or networks of mtDNA haplotypes (the specific
sequences of mutations within haplogroups) that reveal the phylogenetic connections between
each of the haplotypes present in the Karachays.
To assess different population origin models, using the relative genetic contributions of
West and East Eurasian source populations to the Karachays, I compared my data with published
data to see what portion of the Karachay' s genotypes come from a hypothesized source
population, or which surrounding populations could have similar roots. Data from the putative
source populations was taken from the published literature (e.g., Bermisheva et. al. 2004;

20

Derenko et al. 2003; Malyarchuk et. al. 2002a, 2002b; Al-Zahery et al. 2003).

III. Results and Analysis
III. 1 The Karachays

When I had obtained the genealogical information from participants, I had asked about
their birth locations and their parents' and grandparents' birth locations. This would clarify
whether there may have been intermarriage with non-Karachays in their history. Almost all of
the participants had been born in Turkey and immigrated to the United States later in life, so the
fact that they were collected in the US had no bearing on their genetic history. The participants
born in Turkey were also mostly born in Karachay villages, furthering the hypothesis that they
have not intermarried with Turks in Turkey. The first in their families to have come from the
Caucasus were their grandparents, who came in the l 870s-l 890s. This has produced a sample set
which is indicative of the genetic lineages that made it to Turkey when the Karachays fled from
Russian persecution in the late 1800s. For the sake of clarity in Figure 2, I have placed their
geographic location in the Caucasus, where present-day Karachay-Cherkessia exists.
All of the 67 samples collected were able to be amplified and analyzed using the methods
described, except for one which could not be sequenced, but was successful for RFLP analysis.
The resulting data yielded 31 different haplotypes; about every other person had a unique
haplotype. These were grouped into broader haplogroups, and some into subhaplogroups. This
information is in Table 1, and the visual representation of the table is Figure 3.
The network tree that was constructed using the specific sequences is shown in Figure 4.
This represents only the Karachay population and is a specific form of the more general tree of
mitochondrial diversity seen in Figure 5 (Kivisild et. al. 2004). The haplotypes are

21

characterized by the sequence of mutations leading up to the yellow circles. The size of the
yellow circles and their locations represent the number of samples with a given haplotype and
where these particular haplotypes are found in the network.
The high number of haplotypes with respect to the sample size indicates that the sample
is diverse. Also, some of the branches are very long, perhaps indicating old haplotypes that have
not diversified in the recent past, meaning they could have been the result of cultural or
geographical isolation (Schurr and Wallace, 2002). The maternal gene pool may thus not have
been affected by outside influences, but the paternal side may give a different story. Further
analysis would have to be done on the Y-chromosome to clarify this issue.

111.2 Haplogroup Diversity

The diversity of the haplogroups represented is used to understand the extent of the
variation in the individual sequences found. The Karachays had representatives of only the M
and R branches of the mtDNA tree, with only a single sample in the N macrohaplogroup family.
These results indicate a lower diversity than other populations which have representatives of all
macrohaplogroup families (Figures 6a-6o ). However, the number of different U types is
interesting, and indicates high diversity in this haplogroup. Although there was not a high
percentage of M types, those that were present indicated a wide diversity as well, with the
haplogroups D, C, and M represented.
Overall the Karachays had 9% M types, which are East Eurasian lineages as represented
in the Eastern Eurasian network tree in Figure 7 (Kivisild et. al. 2002). Only 2% were N types,
and 89% were R types, both of which are West Eurasian haplogroups. Of all the haplogroups,
the most represented was U, which was 41 % of all samples, with Ul and U5 being the most

22

prevalent. The individual breakdowns of these percentages is shown in Figure 3.

111.3 Comparisons with Other Populations
To understand which populations may have contributed to the Karachay maternal gene
pool, I compared the frequencies ofhaplogroups to other populations found in the published
literature. I chose populations from the Caucasus, the Middle East and Iran (Scythian influence),
Russia, and Central Asia (Turkic origins). Their specific haplogroup frequencies are represented
individually in Table 2, and those which are the most unique are shown in Figures 6a-6o and
geographically in Figure 2. To show more clearly where ethnic groups are located in the
Caucasus, a separate map is given in Figure 8.
The most similar and most dissimilar populations deserve closer analysis. Overall, the
Karachays seemed most similar to the Adygei, which are a Circassian population just west of the
Karachay and who speak a non-Turkic language. Their cultural traditions and folk dances are
similar to the Karachay, and most are Muslim as well. The frequencies of West Eurasian (U, K,
H, HV, J, R, T, W) haplogroups is almost identical to that of the Karachays. The only significant
differences are the absence of W in Karachays, and the absence ofl and HV in Adygei, which
are present in Karachays. The Adygei also have many more H's and less M's than Karachays,
indicating more Western and less Eastern genetic influence. Overall, the similarities present an
expected outcome, since the populations have very little geographic distance between them in the
Caucasus, and significant admixture is likely.
The next most similar population in haplogroup frequency is the Eastern Iranian
population. This was a surprise at first, since they are separated by a large geographic distance,
but when the history of the Karachays as related to the Iranian Scythians was considered, the

23

outcome was supportive of this theory. The frequency in both populations ofM types (Eastern
Eurasian) is the same, 9%, while there are only slight differences in the frequencies of the West
Eurasian types present. The presence of W (West Eurasian), A, and B (East Eurasian), and the
absence ofH and R (West Eurasian) in Eastern Iranians are the only discrepancies with the
Karachay population haplogroups. Karachays have in place of these types more U's instead.
To test whether Karachays have affinities with other Turkic populations in Central Asia,
where Turks originated, I compared with Bashirs (North of Kazakhstan) and Altaians (mountains
NW of Mongolia and NE of Kazakhstan).
Bashkirs have all the same haplogroups present in Karachays, except for R, and some are
even in the same frequencies (H, K, J, I), but Bashkirs have much more diversity, and have both
more Western and Eastern Eurasian types that are not present in Karachays (V, W, F, A, B, NI,
N9, Y). Also, the East Eurasian types (M) prevail in overall frequency, as expected, since they
are closer to East Asia than Karachays. While Karachays have only 9% M's, Bashkirs have 32%
M's.
Altaians were less diverse than Bashkirs, and more similar to Karachays in haplogroup

composition but less in frequency to the Karachays. They had even more M's than Bashkirs
( 45%), but less T's and H's. In these ways they were more dissimilar to the Karachays than
Bashkirs. This is expected, because the Altaians are closer to East Asia than the Bashkirs, who
are in between Altaians and West Eurasia.
These results could indicate that the Turkic or Central Asian population from which some
of the maternal ancestors of the Karachays originated could have been from the Altay region, but
underwent significant admixture as they moved westward into the Caucasus. In addition, this
admixture could have occurred when Iranian Scythians encountered the Qumans and Yenisei

24

Kirgiz from this region near the Altay Mountains before the Qumans moved west toward the
Caucasus.
Interesting to note is that while Karachays are most similar to Adygei, Eastern Iranians,
and somewhat similar to Altaian peoples, they do not seem to have any great affinities, at least
according to haplogroup frequencies, with the Russians (in the west, near Moscow), Ukrainians,
Western Iranians, Turks, Azerbaijanis, and Nogays (eastern Caucasus, near Karachays), all of
which are closer in geographic and political affiliations with the Karachays. The types and
frequencies ofhaplogroups in these populations is very different from the Karachay, and they
can be exclnded on this basis from having had much genetic contribution on the part of the
maternal gene pool. Georgians and Iraqis, which are also close in geographic terms to the
Karachay, are not typically very similar or dissimilar to the Karachay, and can be considered
neutral populations that may have had some genetic contributions, but the evidence is not
overwhelming.
Despite evidence from haplogroup frequencies for the genetic contributions of certain
populations to the Karachay maternal gene pool, these results may not be indicative of actual
migration patterns and true origins. This is because haplogroups may be similar in broad terms,
but the populations in question could have totally different and non-overlapping haplotypes
within those haplogroups. Also, although two populations could have different frequencies of
haplogroups, one population may have received most of a specific haplotype of a less prominent
haplogroup from a neighboring population with many haplotypes representative of that group.
Thus, these results are only preliminary, and to elucidate further the contributions of various
populations, more statistical analysis on this data, and further research on the Y-chromosome
patterns must be done.

25

IV. Conclusions
The Karachays, according to history, were descended from a variety of peoples, including
the Scythians, Alans, Hunno-Bulgars, and Qurnans. To help clarify which populations currently
represent those that have contributed to the genetic identity of the Karachays in the Caucasus, I
have analyzed the mitochondrial DNA from this population, and compared the resulting
haplogroup frequencies to those of the pertinent populations.
Results indicate that Karachays are not related closely to those groups that are closest in
geographic distance, except for the Adygei, who are located right to the West of the Karachay.
Instead, the closest in haplogroup types and frequencies seem to be the Eastern Iranians and
Altaians.
These outcomes are supportive of the theory that Karachays are descendants of ancient
Turkic peoples from the Altay Mountains (Huns-Bulgars), who have moved westward into the
Caucasus and later admixed with Turkic Qurnans (also from near Altay and Yenisei River
Basin), who also had previously admixed with ancient Iranian peoples from the Caspian Region
(Scythians and Alans).
Thus, this study indicates that the Karachay do not have one clear picture of their genetic
past. Indeed, it is very complex, and to contribute more to the understanding of this intriguing
problem, it is necessary to complete further research on the genetics of the Karachay people.

Appendix II (2 pages): Informed Consent Form

Informed Consent Form
The Genetic History of the Karachays
PI: Theodore G. Schurr, Ph.D., Assistant Professor
Department of Anthropology, University of Pennsylvania,
325 University Museum, 3260 South Street, Philadelphia, PA. 19104-6398
Tel#: 215-573-7632; Email: tgschurr@sas.upenn.edu
Collaborator: Ms. Aslihan Sen
669 Franklin Lakes Road, Franklin Lakes, NJ. 07417
Tel#: (201) 485-8825; Email: aslihan@sas.upenn.edu

Invitation to Participate: You are invited to participate in a study of genetic variation of the
Karai;:ays to elucidate their history and origins in West Asia and the Caucasus.

Purpose: In this research project, we will survey your mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and Y
chromosome genes for sequence variation. Small mutations in these portions of your genome create
genetic markers that can be used to characterize human populations. These changes identify specific
genetic lineages within human populations that can be traced through maternal (mtDNA) and
paternal (Y chromosome) lineages. For these reasons, we can trace these mutations through human
families from the present to the distant past with considerable accuracy. We can also reconstruct
patterns of human movement through geographic areas by tracking the spread of these lineages in
different human groups.
Procedures: If you decide to participate, we will obtain buccal (cheek) samples from you. This
procedure requires only 5-10 minutes, and will not subject you to any significant health risks. We
will also ask you to complete a short questionnaire about your family history before providing the
buccal samples. The whole process will take no more than 30-60 minutes. The buccal cells will be
taken back to the PI's (Schurr) laboratory at the University of Pennsylvania, and DNA will be
extracted from them . The DNA will then be analyzed for mtDNA and Y-chromosome variation
using molecular biology methods. Upon the completion of the study, the DNA samples will be
destroyed to prevent further use of them outside of the parameters of this project.

Potential Risks or Discomforts to Participant: The buccal cell collection procedure requires
only a few minutes to complete, and may result in very minor discomfort. Beyond the temporary
discomfort, this procedure will subject you to no other significant health risks.

Benefits to Participant: There are no direct benefits to you as a result of your participation in this
study. However, it is our hope that, by analyzing the sequence variation in the DNA from your
buccal cells, we will more fully elucidate the history of the Karai;:ays.

Confidentiality: During the research project, all genetic and genealogical data will be kept in
computerized form in the PI's laboratory, and accessed by only those persons involved in the

54

project. Any data under the researchers' control will be disclosed in scientific reports or public
presentations in a manner that does not reveal your identity. The data obtained by the analysis of
your DNA will also be made available to you upon your request.
Compensation and Medical Treatment: While there is minimal risk to you in taking buccal cell
samples, should any discomfort arise during this process, the medical personnel involved in sample
collection will provide the requisite treatment. There will also be no financial compensation for your
participation.
Research Contacts: Should you have any questions about this project or your rights as a research
participant, please contact the PI (Schurr) at the mailing address, telephone number, or email
address provided above.
Terms of Participation: Your participation in this research project is completely voluntaty, and you
may withdraw from it at any time.
Conclusion: You have read and understand the consent form. You agree to participate in this
research study.
